# Hugo & NicFab
After many years in the company of WordPress, we have completed the migration of our NicFab blog to Hugo.

Our decision came after a careful reflection that led us to consider the features of Hugo and related resources, not excluding the success of the publication of NicFab Notes which is our digital notebook for which we used the same, Hugo.

Hugo proves to be a performing and modular solution, suitable for our needs and allowing us better management of the contributions to be published.

If you are interested in learning more about Hugo, you can read our post published on [NicFab Notes](https://notes.nicfab.it/it/it/posts/hugo/hugo/).

Enjoy reading!
